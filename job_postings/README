Helping Ritesh and Simon debug their job posting scripts after they got banned from Monster.com. 
So far so good for me on getting banned, and I've saved results for searching as written in their script.

Also fixed a bug where for loop would break if job posting page did not contain a proper "JobDescription" node.
